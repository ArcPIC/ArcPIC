ArcPIC
======

ArcPIC 2D is a 2D3V vacuum arc particle-in-cell simulation code. It is documented in [CLIC note 1032](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1951304), and was used to produce the simulation results presented in the paper [From Field Emission to Vacuum Arc Ignition: A New Tool for Simulating Copper Vacuum Arcs](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctpp.201400069/abstract) by H. Timko, K. Ness Sjobak, L. Mether, S. Calatroni, F. Djurabekova, K. Matyash, K. Nordlund, R. Schneider and W. Wuensch in Contributions to Plasma Physics, April 2015.
